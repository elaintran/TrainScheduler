# TrainScheduler
The Train Scheduler is a schedule application that utilizes Firebase and Moment.js to store train data and reflect updates real-time. Users are able to submit train information, such as destination, arrival time, and minutes remaining. Along with that, they can go back and edit or delete their previously submitted trains from the table.

### User Stories
One of UT Austin Coding Bootcampâ€™s database projects is to create a train scheduler with the following user stories:
* I am able to submit information about my train.
* I can see when my train will arrive, relative to the current time.
* I am able to update or remove each train.
